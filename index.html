        <img src="assets/images/picture.jpg" class="pro-image" alt="dog pic">

        <p>Interested in the application of software to solve problems ranging from an everyday level to complex enterprise issues.
        Recently enrolled in a full-stack developer course, I hope to step in a role that will challenge me and give me the opportunity
        to grow myself by answering the needs of today and tomorrow. Relatable and a team player I strive to find and fill my niche
        in a group whether it be supporting, spearheading innovation and change, or leading the organization and execution of the
        groups purpose.
        </p>
        <p> Always open to new perspective and rethinking concepts to reach new levels of potential I look forward to
        one day being attached to something that makes peopleâ€™s lives easier.
        </p>
